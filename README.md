First learning project for Node app - just a test 'play' around with Node, JS, MongoDB, Bootstrap/HTML/CSS 'stuff'

`npm install` required for packages and app can be run with `npm run start`. Database can be run with `mongod` and in another terminal the shell can be accessed with `mongo`.

Authentication/Log in to be looked at next.
