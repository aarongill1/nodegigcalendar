First learning project for Node app - just a test 'play' around with Node, JS, MongoDB, Bootstrap/HTML/CSS 'stuff'

npm install required for packages and app can be run with npm run start

GET/POST routes work but just with an array at present - will add MongoDB functionality next before PUT/DELETE routes.
